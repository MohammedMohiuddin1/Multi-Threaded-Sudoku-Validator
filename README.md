### Multi-Threaded Sudoku Validator

A program that leverages multi-threading (3N threads, where N is the size of the puzzle) to efficiently verify the validity of a Sudoku puzzle. The program checks if the puzzle adheres to Sudoku rules (each number 1-9 appears only once per row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid) using parallel processing to handle different sections of the puzzle simultaneously, improving performance for larger puzzles. Additionally, the program includes logic to automatically fill in missing numbers, providing a solution for incomplete puzzles, and ensures the validity of the final result. This multi-threaded approach speeds up validation, making it suitable for both smaller and larger Sudoku puzzles while ensuring accuracy and optimal efficiency.
